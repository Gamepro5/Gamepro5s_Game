I won't bore you with the details, but basically nothing related to this can be used without permission from me. This game uses Godot to help with rendering and cross platform shenanigans. Everything from the modified engine I use to the game itself is proprietary. This license may change in the future.

Here are some things to keep in mind:

* You may record yourself playing this game and make money if you want, but you must provide some way for the viewer to trace back to the game's main page (currently [this page](https://gamepro5.com/game)).
* Never will you be punished for taking advantage of a bug. If you find a bug, I would appreciate you reporting it but I would have to be a [real idiot](https://youtu.be/EoLWxIwyNiE?t=315) to punish people for discovering my mistakes.
* There is no modding API is available right now and I don't know whether it will ever be a thing, so right now modding is prohibited because it would mean modifying a proprietary game's code.
